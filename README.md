A section detailing issues, including any functionality that is missing

	Currently, our program does take in user input, however, it does not print out the correct metadata.
	After the user inputs what processor they would like to use, the new file of the edits isn't saved and an error is thrown.
	In other words, the new modified wave file is not written due to the error tht is thrown.
	All in all, the issues we have is the metadata not being dipslayed correctly and not being able to produce a modified wav file based on the processor the user selects to use for their wav file.


A section detailing the challenges that you encountered in the project

	Timothy: finding algorithms that explain themselves to a useful degree.
	Rubi: Figuring out how to save the data of the modified original wave file into another file.



Instructions for building the application if anything is required beyond make

	Currently there are no additional steps required.
