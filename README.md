A section detailing the challenges that you encountered in the project

	Timothy: finding low-pass filter algorithms that explain things beyond "well, you're probably going to want to phase shift somewhere" or "well, here's a circuit diagram. good luck with the digitizing." Similar issues with the compressor.
